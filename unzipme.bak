\ nottt6 we have 6
\ state and how we got there
\ how do we use the dix to reset down ?

we subtract the 6 from AxC and restore AxD

\ A   we compare Axd  SEARCDIG  NEW AxC   == New Tax   if nottt6 returns 0 to lastxdig 4 we have our next digit down

\  we reset AxB (old AxC

\ C  we write the digit to AxC and  run  search nottt6 again untill lastxdig4 0=  write to AxC  and loop



\ The  Unzip Process

\  We need to create the stack state before AxC   withe the digit that created AxC

\ We do this by a zero answer ( lasrxdig4 = 0)  and the loop number is our laSTDIG  (  i )

\ We now update AxB and AxC with this new data AxB is updated by moving AxC to AxB and  AxC is xored by the (i found digit)

\ and the process is looped
