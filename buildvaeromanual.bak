\ UNZIP:  cxaall  to clear all data   cx10  xad axb xor(spp)

\  this get digit  cx10 |gets digit| N1  |axc and xad have digit|  now xor it with axb  (spp)  move axb to move spp axb xor  create s2p
\ N1 = xad  axb xor (result stored in ??? ) store xac !

\ last run     cx10  dox88 cx1     /  tells us a six ran last  so xor it with axb     axb @ axa @ xor xad !   xad @ axc @ xor axc !
\                              /  update axb
\  CXWW should reset s2 to prev
\

\                     / rebuild S2
\           doxt77 doxt10
\ first unxip must xor axc with new newchar(axx) and store on xad  this sets xad (dodx) to prec char
\ unzip
\ create next char by using testball  ---  scan axa for char that zero+1
\  executing this char on testbaal gives us last char

\  j is xored by axb stored in xad (spp) (if its unchanged)
\  spp (xad) is xored with current s2 axc   result stored in S2 axc( must not be changed by c22)
\  axa now updated    csp2  axb to axa  which is cx10 again
